# Real Time Bus Tracker
## Description of the project: 
### This project helps determine the route the bus is taking through each stop. The User Journey Thought Process: She works at LA City Hall and live nearby. So, she takes the bus home. She's coming out of work at 6PM. She wants to know how long it takes her to get back home to Chinatown. 
#### Solutions Provided in this Concept
- Pop-up Feature: Include Bus Station #, Time duration to arrival for each Bus Stop (based off how fast the bus is going) 
- Color Code Marker: Red for the User Marker. It will layer on top of the existing Bus Markers all the way to arrival to help the User determine where they are at. 
## How to Run: 
### Can run on the console. (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
## Roadmap of future improvements: 
### User will be pinged on their cell phone for each stop arrival. This helps with accessibility problems to help the impaired that they have made it to the next bus station.
